## API

The backend is powered by [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/).  
Key API endpoints are implemented as Next.js API routes (see `/src/app/api/`):

- `POST /api/answer` â€” Create a new answer
- `DELETE /api/answer` â€” Delete an answer
- Additional endpoints for questions, votes, and user management are implemented similarly.

All API routes expect and return JSON.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your_appwrite_endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_appwrite_project_id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_appwrite_api_key
```

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`: Your Appwrite endpoint URL (e.g., `http://localhost/v1`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Appwrite project ID
